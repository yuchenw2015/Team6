# Team6

The goal of Team6 is to write the solutions of team 1, team 3, and team 8 in Lab 2 as functions.

## Github
The github of Team6 is [here](https://github.com/yuchenw2015/Team6)

## Problem we have
When we run devtools::check(), there is an error "there is no package called 'class'". However, we did not use this package, and this error cannot be fixed even we install and library this package.
